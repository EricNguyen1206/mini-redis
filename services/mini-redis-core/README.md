# Mini-Redis Core Service

A high-performance, lightweight Redis-compatible server focused exclusively on core functionality. This service is optimized for maximum throughput and minimal latency without any web interface or monitoring overhead.

## Supported Commands

### Primary Commands (Core Functionality)

#### SET
**Syntax:** `SET key value`

**Description:** Store a key-value pair in the database. This is the fundamental write operation for Mini-Redis.

**Examples:**
```redis
SET user:1 "John Doe"
# Response: OK

SET counter 42
# Response: OK

SET session:abc123 "user_data"
# Response: OK
```

**Return Values:**
- Simple string `OK` on successful storage

#### GET
**Syntax:** `GET key`

**Description:** Retrieve the value of a key from the database. This is the fundamental read operation for Mini-Redis.

**Examples:**
```redis
GET user:1
# Response: "John Doe"

GET counter
# Response: "42"

GET nonexistent
# Response: (nil)
```

**Return Values:**
- Bulk string with the value if key exists
- Null bulk string `(nil)` if key doesn't exist

#### DEL
**Syntax:** `DEL key [key ...]`

**Description:** Delete one or more keys from the database. Returns the number of keys that were actually deleted.

**Examples:**
```redis
DEL user:1
# Response: (integer) 1

DEL key1 key2 key3
# Response: (integer) 2  (if only 2 keys existed)

DEL nonexistent
# Response: (integer) 0
```

**Return Values:**
- Integer representing the number of keys that were successfully deleted

### Pub/Sub Commands (Real-time Messaging)

#### SUBSCRIBE
**Syntax:** `SUBSCRIBE channel [channel ...]`

**Description:** Subscribe to one or more channels for real-time messaging. The client will receive all messages published to subscribed channels.

**Examples:**
```redis
SUBSCRIBE news
# Response: ["subscribe", "news", 1]

SUBSCRIBE news sports weather
# Response:
# ["subscribe", "news", 1]
# ["subscribe", "sports", 2]
# ["subscribe", "weather", 3]
```

**Return Values:**
- Array for each channel: ["subscribe", channel_name, total_subscription_count]

#### UNSUBSCRIBE
**Syntax:** `UNSUBSCRIBE [channel ...]`

**Description:** Unsubscribe from specified channels. If no channels are specified, unsubscribes from all channels.

**Examples:**
```redis
UNSUBSCRIBE news
# Response: ["unsubscribe", "news", 2]

UNSUBSCRIBE
# Response: Unsubscribe confirmations for all subscribed channels
```

**Return Values:**
- Array for each channel: ["unsubscribe", channel_name, remaining_subscription_count]

#### PUBLISH
**Syntax:** `PUBLISH channel message`

**Description:** Publish a message to a channel. All clients subscribed to the channel will receive the message immediately.

**Examples:**
```redis
PUBLISH news "Breaking: New Redis server released!"
# Response: (integer) 3  (3 subscribers received the message)

PUBLISH empty_channel "Hello"
# Response: (integer) 0  (no subscribers)
```

**Return Values:**
- Integer representing the number of subscribers that received the message
